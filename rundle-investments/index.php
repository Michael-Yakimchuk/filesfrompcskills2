    <p>Preserve capital and maintain liquidity. To support and grow your business, you need to make the most of excess balances. This involves 
    not simply knowing where cash is, but also having the right tools to access and use funds in the most effective way possible. That’s why our savings, 
    equity and investment solutions are designed to help you consolidate balances for faster, easier access to capital when it’s needed – helping you 
    put idle funds to work growing liquidity and protecting your business.

        <h3>Investment Counselling</h3>
        <p>Investment Counselling is grounded on communication and understanding: we strive to gain an in-depth knowledge of our clients’ unique circumstances and objectives. To develop this holistic understanding, your dedicated investment counsellor will work with you to create an investment portfolio that reflects your time horizon and individual investment goals.       
        This is a discretionary service—this means your dedicated investment counsellor manages your portfolio on your behalf. This provides peace of mind by freeing you from the ongoing decision-making surrounding your portfolios.
        Rundle provides Investment Counselling for individuals, families, holding corporations, foundations, trusts and estates.
