Founded in 1974, Rundle Investments is a privately owned, independent investment firm, managing over $50 billion in assets for individual and institutional investors across all major investment strategies. We have over 150 employees across our locations in Calgary, Toronto, and Singapore.  Mount Rundle is visible from our massive office in downtown Calgary.
For over 40 years, we have provided investment management for our clients using our “boring” investment approach. This approach has helped our clients safely and profitably navigate the investing landscape over many economic cycles. Our mission is to be our clients’ most trusted investment manager by delivering long-term investment excellence, building strong client partnerships, and making a commitment to do the right thing—always-no-matter-what-'cause-that's-what-we-do.
