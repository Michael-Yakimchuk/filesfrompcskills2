What does this Fund Invest In?
The Fund invests primarily in equity and equity-related securities of entities outside of Canada and the United States. The amount invested in any one country will vary depending upon individual company by company opportunities in each area.

Treasury bills or short-term investments, not exceeding three years to maturity, may also be used from time to time.

The Manager employs a highly disciplined, research-driven, bottom-up process and long-term holding period to allow for investor recognition or corporate growth, and to minimize transaction costs.
