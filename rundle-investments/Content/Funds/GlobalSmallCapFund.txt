What does this Fund Invest In?
The Fund invests primarily in equity and equity-related securities of smaller companies around the world with less than $3 billion USD in market cap at time of purchase. The amount invested in any one country will vary depending upon individual company by company opportunities in each area. The Fund will diversify through currencies, industries, and countries to increase safety, and to increase the growth and liquidity of the investments. Treasury bills or short-term investments, not exceeding three years to maturity, may also be used from time to time.

Investor Suitability
Investors seeking long-term, above average growth who can tolerate equity volatility. High Risk.

Investment Strategy
In order to achieve its investment strategy objectives, the Manager systematically creates a broadly diversified portfolio of wealth-creating companies with excellent management teams bought at discounts to their intrinsic values. The Manager employs a highly disciplined, research-driven, bottom-up process and long-term holding period to allow for investor recognition or corporate growth, and to minimize transaction costs.
