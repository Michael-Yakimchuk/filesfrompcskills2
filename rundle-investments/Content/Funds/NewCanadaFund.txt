New Canada Fund (CLOSED)

The Rundle New Canada Fund is capped to new and existing mutual fund investors. This has been done given the limited liquidity of the securities in the small cap segment of the Canadian equity market and given our desire to ensure that we continue to offer the best possible small cap product to our existing clients.
