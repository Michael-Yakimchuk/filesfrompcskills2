Investment Strategy
The Manager’s traditional equity approach of systematically buying wealth creating companies at a discount to intrinsic value is used to construct the equity part of the portfolio. The fixed income part of the portfolio follows our traditional fixed income approach of focusing on sector allocation, security selection, and trading strategies. For asset mix, the Manager analyzes which combination of asset classes is most likely to offer the most attractive risk/return characteristics within a medium to long-term time frame, and carries out asset mix changes gradually to reduce risk.
