        <h3>What does this Fund Invest In?</h3>
        The Fund invests primarily in securities of smaller Canadian companies.   Treasury bills or short-term investments, not exceeding three years to  maturity, may still be used from time to time.<br>

        <h3>Investor Suitability</h3>
        Investors seeking long-term, above average growth who can tolerate significant volatility. High risk.

        <h3>Investment Strategy</h3>
        In order to achieve its investment strategy objectives, the Manager systematically creates a broadly diversified portfolio of wealth-creating companies with excellent management teams bought at discounts to their intrinsic values. The Manager employs a highly disciplined, research-driven, bottom-up process and a long-term holding period to allow for investor recognition or corporate growth, and to minimize transaction costs.
