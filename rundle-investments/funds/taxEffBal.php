        <h3>What does this Fund Invest In?</h3>
        The fund may invest up to all of its assets in equity and equity-related   securities, treasury bills, short-term notes, debentures and bonds from   Canadian, U.S. and international issuers or in other funds managed by   Mawer. They can be of any size and from any industry.<br>

        <h3>Investor Suitability</h3>
        Investors seeking long-term growth at medium risk with tax effectiveness.

        <h3>Investment Strategy</h3>
        The Managerâ€™s traditional equity approach of systematically buying wealth  creating companies at a discount to intrinsic value is used to construct the equity part of the portfolio. The fixed income part of the portfolio follows our traditional fixed income approach of focusing on sector allocation, security selection, and trading strategies. For asset mix, the Manager analyzes which combination of asset classes is most likely to offer the most attractive risk/return characteristics within a medium to long-term time frame, and carries out asset mix changes gradually to reduce risk. The manager minimizes taxes through the application of a tax overlay strategy, with the objective to minimize taxable distributions.
