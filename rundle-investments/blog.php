        <h1 class="title">The top 15 macro questions to ask before investing in a country</h1>
        <h3>Posted May 16, 2018 by Kara Lilly</h3>
        <p>As you may recall, Argentina issued a 100-year bond last year. Aptly dubbed the “Houdini” bond, the issuance attracted a lot of attention from investors, not the least because Argentina has among the worst of investment reputations (see: experiencing triple-digit inflation in the 1980s and a deep economic depression in the late 1990s). As a country with a historic tendency to periodically stride into virulent populist policymaking, the recent 2015 Presidential election of centre-right Mauricio Macri was a welcome shift and had brightened some of Argentina’s economic prospects. But Argentina is back in the news and yet again facing a major financial threat. </p>

        <h1 class="title">“Certified fresh” lessons from machine learning</h1>
        <h3>Posted May 2, 2018 by Siying Li and Kara Lilly</h3>
        <p>he effects of machine learning are all around us: email spam filters, driverless cars, voice recognition software (hi, Alexa) and even movie recommendation sites like Rotten Tomatoes. Technology is certainly changing the investing landscape. Naturally, many now wonder whether man or machine will come out on top. But this dichotomous framing is too narrow and misses an opportunity. Humans and machines have different strengths and weaknesses, and on our team, we tend to see the foreseeable future as a world in which the two work side-by-side. As with any tool, for machine learning to be useful, it is what it is being used for and how that matters.</p>

        <h3>Posted March 14, 2018 by Samir Taghiyev</h3>
        <p>A commonly held idea with respect to smaller companies is that with less resources and sophistication, they will tend to have a mostly domestic business. While that can be the case, it is possible for smaller companies to punch above their weight in a foreign market. In our Canadian small cap portfolio, there have been many wealth-creating companies that were able to successfully expand and compete in the United States. Six of the portfolio’s top ten holdings derive the majority of their revenues from our southerly neighbours, and 40% of the weighted average revenue of the portfolio comes from the States. That is perhaps more southern exposure in a Canadian strategy than one might expect, but we would argue that’s a good thing.

        <h3>Posted February 14, 2018 by Rundle</h3>
        <p>Last Monday, after a lengthy period of strong performance, global equity markets stumbled with the S and P 500 down 7.8% and the S and P/TSX Composite down 6.6% from their highs in January.<br><br>While investor apprehension in this environment is understandable, volatility in markets is both normal and expected. Looking back through our Art of Boring archive, we were struck by the enduring relevance of not letting fear guide investor decision-making during jittery times. We were also buoyed to see reads from the current media waters encouraging the same.</p>
